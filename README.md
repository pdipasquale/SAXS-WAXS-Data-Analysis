A file collection for data processing and analysis at the Australian 
Synchrotron's SAXS/WAXS beamline. 
===============================================================================

Please note that an emphasis has been placed on safe and efficient 
analysis which accommodates many of the specialised requirements of the 
beamline. 

We hope that as this repository is upated, a useful set of tools for future 
experimenters will be produced. At present, files concerning file conversion 
such as dat_to_tif.py may be particularly useful. 

This collection is in ongoing use as part of a joint research effort with teams
led by Dr. Chanh Tran and Prof. Christopher Chantler.
